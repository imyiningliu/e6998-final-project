# E6998 Final Project: Deep Learning for Molecular Classification
## A description of the project 
The goal of the project is to study the power of deep learning to predict molecular properties. In achieving this goal, we first review and compare methods to perform deep learning on graphs. Then, we experiment various model architectures and learning algorithms. Lastly, we evaluate the trained models on the molecular property prediction task. 

Through the project, we hope to illustrate how to train deep learning models on graph input data and demonstrate the potential of using deep learning for scientific discoveries.
